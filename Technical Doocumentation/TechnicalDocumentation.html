     <h3>What is Java ?</h3>
     <p>Java is a widely used object-oriented programming language and software platform that runs on billions of devices, including notebook computers, mobile devices, gaming consoles, medical devices and many others. The rules and syntax of Java are based on the C and C++ languages.

        One major advantage of developing software with Java is its portability. Once you have written code for a Java program on a notebook computer, it is very easy to move the code to a mobile device. When the language was invented in 1991 by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems (later acquired by Oracle), the primary goal was to be able to "write once, run anywhere."
        
        It's also important to understand that Java is much different from JavaScript. Javascript does not need to be compiled, while Java code does need to be compiled. Also, Javascript only runs on web browsers while Java can be run anywhere.
        
        New and improved software development tools are coming to market at a remarkable pace, displacing incumbent products once thought to be indispensable. In light of this continual turnover, Java’s longevity is impressive; more than two decades after its creation, Java is still the most popular language for application software development—developers continue to choose it over languages such as Python, Ruby, PHP, Swift, C++, and others. As a result, Java remains an important requirement for competing in the job market.</p>

    <h3>Object and Classes</h3>
    <p>
    <p style="background-color: rgb(227,169,236);"><b>Object --</b> an encapsulation of data along with functions that act upon that.</p>
<b>An object consists of:</b><br>

<li><b>Name -- </b>the variable name we give it</li>
<li><b>Member data -- </b>the data that describes the object</li>
<li><b>Member functions -- </b>behavior aspects of the object (functions related to the object itself)</li>
<span style="background-color: rgb(227, 169, 236);"><b>Class -- </b>a blueprint for objects. A class is a user-defined type that describes what a certain type of object will look like.</span><span> A class description consists of a declaration and a definition. Usually these pieces are split into separate files.<br></span>

An object is a single instance of a class. You can create many objects from the same class type.

<p><b>DDU Design - Declare, Define, Use:</b></p>
<p><b>Declare - </b>A declaration gives an interface.  A variable declaration gives the type.  A function declaration tells how to use it, without bothering with how it works.  A class declaration shows what an object will look like and what its available functions are. Again, implementation details aren't needed here.</p>
<p><b>Define - </b>A definition usually consists of the implementation details.  This part doesn't need to be seen by the user of the interface.  A function definition is the code that makes a function work (the function body).  A class definition consists definitions of its members.</p>

<p><b>Use - </b>The use of an item, through its interface.  The user of an executable program uses the graphic interface, keyboard, and mouse.  The user of a function is a programmer, who makes calls to the function (without needing to know the implementation details).  The user of a class is also a programmer, who uses the class by creating objects and calling the available functions for those objects.</p>

Note -- The concept of interface is a very important one in object-oriented programming.  The interface is what the user sees.  We often leave the implementation details hidden.  We want to strive to create a clear interface for the user (not necessarily the end user of a program -- could be a programmer, i.e. the user of a class).

    <h3>Inheritance</h3>
<p><b>Inheritance</b> in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).

    The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.
    
    Inheritance represents the <b style="background-color: floralwhite;">IS-A relationship</b> which is also known as a parent-child relationship.
    
    Why use inheritance in java
    For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
    For Code Reusability.
    Terms used in Inheritance <br>
    <b>Class:</b> A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. <br>
    <b>Sub Class/Child Class:</b> Subclass is a class which inherits the other class. It is also called a derived class, extended class, or child class. <br>
   <b> Super Class/Parent Class:</b> Superclass is the class from where a subclass inherits the features. It is also called a base class or a parent class. <br>
   <b> Reusability: </b>As the name specifies, reusability is a mechanism which facilitates you to reuse the fields and methods of the existing class when you create a new class. You can use the same fields and methods already defined in the previous class. <br>
   <u style="font-size: 20px;"> The syntax of Java Inheritance</u>
   <p style="background-color: gainsboro;width: 400px;border-radius: 8px;">
    <span class="text-primary">class</span> Subclass-name <span class="text-primary">extends</span> Superclass-name  <br>
    {  <br>
        <span class="text-success">//methods and fields</span>  <br>
    }  </p>
    The extends keyword indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class. The meaning of "extends" is to increase the functionality.</p>
</div>
<div id="poly" class="container-fluid">
    <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
  <p><i>Polymorphism</i> is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

    Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic. In Java, all Java objects are polymorphic since any object will pass the IS-A test for their own type and for the class Object.
 <br>   
    It is important to know that the only possible way to access an object is through a reference variable. A reference variable can be of only one type. Once declared, the type of a reference variable cannot be changed.
   <br> 
    The reference variable can be reassigned to other objects provided that it is not declared final. The type of the reference variable would determine the methods that it can invoke on the object.
    <br>
    A reference variable can refer to any object of its declared type or any subtype of its declared type. A reference variable can be declared as a class or interface type.
    <br>
    <b>Example</b><br>
    Let us look at an example.
    <p style="background-color: gainsboro; font-style: italic;width:430px;border-radius: 5px;">
    public interface Vegetarian{} <br>
    public <span class="text-primary">class</span> Animal{} <br>
    public <span class="text-primary">class</span> Deer <span class="text-primary">extends</span> Animal implements Vegetarian{}</p></p>
</div>
<div id="abs" class="container-fluid">
    <h3>Abstraction</h3>
    <p> Abstraction is the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events. For example, when you consider the case of e-mail, complex details such as what happens as soon as you send an e-mail, the protocol your e-mail server uses are hidden from the user. Therefore, to send an e-mail you just need to type the content, mention the address of the receiver, and click send.

        Likewise in Object-oriented programming, abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user. In other words, the user will have the information on what the object does instead of how it does it.
        
        In Java, abstraction is achieved using Abstract classes and interfaces.
        <br>
        <i style="font-size: 20px;">Abstract Class </i> <br>
        A class which contains the abstract keyword in its declaration is known as abstract class.
     <li>   
        Abstract classes may or may not contain abstract methods, i.e., methods without body ( public void get(); )</li>
        
        <li>
        But, if a class has at least one abstract method, then the class <b>must</b> be declared abstract.</li>
        <li>
        If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated.
        </li>
        <li>
        To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.
       </li>
       <li>
        If you inherit an abstract class, you have to provide implementations to all the abstract methods in it.
        </li>
        <b>Example</b> <br>
        This section provides you an example of the abstract class. To create an abstract class, just use the <b>abstract</b> keyword before the class keyword, in the class declaration.</p>
        <p style="background-color: gainsboro; border-radius: 8px;margin-left: 10px;width:800px"> <span class="text-success">/* File name : AbstractDemo.java */ </span><br>
            public class AbstractDemo { <br>
            
               public static void main(String [] args) { <br>
                <span class="text-success">  /* Following is not allowed and would raise error */ </span> <br>
                  Employee e = new Employee("George W.", "Houston, TX", 43); <br>
                  System.out.println("\n Call mailCheck using Employee reference--"); <br>
                  e.mailCheck(); <br>
               } <br>
            }</p>
</div>
<div id="encap">
    <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
    <p>In normal terms Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. In Object Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulates them. Consider a real life example of encapsulation,in a company there are different sections like thhe account section, finance section, sales section etc. The finance section handdles all the financial transactions and keep records of all the data related to finance. Similarly the sales section handles all the sales related activities and keep record of all the sales. Now there may arise a situation when for some reasons an official form finance section needs all the data about sales in a particular month. In this case,he is not allowed to directly acees the data of sales section. He woll foirst have to contact some other officers in the sales section and then request to give the particular data. This is what encapsulation is. Here the data of sales section and the employess that can manipulate them are wrapped under a single name "sales section". <br>
    Encapsulation also leds to data abstraction or hiding. as using encapsulation also hides the data. In the above example the data of any of the section like sales,finance or accounts is hidden from any other section.<br>
In C++ encapsulation can be implemented using Class and access modifiers.</p>
